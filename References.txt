In 1915, Albert Einstein published "The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity," 
which describes the mathematical framework of general relativity and its predictions 
for the behavior of gravity and space-time.

John A. Wheeler's 1955 paper, "Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam," 
explores the properties of black holes and their potential to warp 
space-time and create wormholes.

Kip S. Thorne's book "Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy" (1994) 
discusses the concept of wormholes and their theoretical properties for space-time travel.

Matt Visser's book "Lorentzian Wormholes: From Einstein to Hawking" (1996) 
provides an in-depth exploration of the properties of wormholes and their 
potential for space-time travel.

In 1994, Miguel Alcubierre proposed the concept of the "warp drive," 
a theoretical method of space-time travel that involves expanding and 
contracting space-time using negative energy.
