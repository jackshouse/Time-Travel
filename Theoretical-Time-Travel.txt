Theoretical Framework for Time Travel:

The framework for time travel is based on the following principles:

General Relativity: According to the theory of general relativity, gravity 
is the curvature of space-time. Massive objects create a "well" in 
space-time, causing other objects to move towards them. Therefore, it is 
possible to manipulate space-time to create a path for time travel.

Wormholes: Wormholes are theoretical objects that connect two points
in space-time. The concept of a wormhole involves folding space-time to 
create a shortcut between two distant points. Wormholes are allowed by 
the laws of physics, but require negative energy to stabilize them.

Quantum Mechanics: Quantum mechanics is the study of the behavior of 
particles on the atomic and subatomic level. The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen 
paradox describes the correlation between two quantum systems that are 
separated by distance. This paradox is important for time travel because 
it suggests that information can be transmitted instantaneously across space-time.

Negative Energy: Negative energy is a theoretical form of energy that 
has the potential to stabilize a wormhole and prevent its collapse. 
Negative energy has not been directly observed, but is allowed by the laws of physics.

Based on these principles, the following formula for time travel is proposed:

ER = EPR * T * D / (-E)

Where:
ER = Einstein-Rosen bridge or wormhole that connects two distant points in space-time
EPR = Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, describing the correlation between two quantum systems
T = Time as a property of the universe, which is constantly in motion
D = Destination or the specific point in space-time where the traveler wishes to arrive
(-E) = Negative energy, which is a theoretical form of energy that has the
potential to stabilize a wormhole and prevent its collapse.

The formula suggests that time travel is not just about when an event occurred,
but also about where it occurred in space-time. By incorporating the concept 
of negative energy, it is possible to stabilize a wormhole and enable a traveler to traverse it safely.

While this theoretical framework for time travel is based on existing theories 
and concepts, it is important to note that it is still highly speculative and 
experimental. Further research and experimentation will be necessary to 
determine the feasibility and safety of using wormholes for time travel. 
Nonetheless, this framework represents an exciting and potentially 
groundbreaking advancement in our understanding of the universe and the possibilities of space-time travel.
